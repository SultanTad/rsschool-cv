## Briefly About Myself:

I really enjoy development and one of my goals is to become a senior full stack web developer. What about my strengths are perseverance and perseverance, I am ready to go to the end and I believe that I will definitely achieve my goals. I came to this course not a beginner in development, I have little experience, I studied python for 7 months, then I went for an internship at a local company, it was my friend's web studio, but there was no python, there was javascript and layout, i.e. e frontend. The internship lasted 3 months. Unfortunately, I did not pass the internship, but I did not give up and moved on.I went to another small company and now I'm doing an internship in it, and it seems that soon I will participate in the development of a combat project, we will write in Vue and Nuxt. Also in parallel I am doing an online store project where I use Node, Postgres and Express, the frontend will most likely be Vue. The project has not yet been uploaded to git, so I can’t throw off the code example.But there are pioneers in the code of educational projects:
1. https://github.com/SultanTad/vue_test, 
2. https://github.com/SultanTad/django-dartblog-practic,
3. https://github.com/SultanTad/django-project-tutorial

**That is, based on this, you can understand that I have basic knowledge of programming, namely such technologies as:**
* Python
* HTML, CSS, Javascript, Vue3
* Node, Express, PostgreSQL
* Git, GitHab
* I also know a little about such a pattern as MVC.

## Code example:

*After learning that DNA is not a random string, newly enrolled computer science students at the Institute of Bioinformatics proposed using a compression algorithm that compresses repeated characters in a string.*

**Encoding is done as follows:**
s = 'aaaabbсaa' is converted to 'a4b2с1a2', that is, groups of identical characters of the source string are replaced with this character and the number of its repetitions in this position of the string.

*Write a program that reads a string, encodes it with the proposed algorithm, and outputs the encoded sequence to standard output. Encoding must be case-sensitive.*
```
genome = input()
x = 1
cnt = 1
genome2 = genome[x:x + 1]
for i in genome:
    if i in genome2:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        print(i, cnt, sep="", end="")
        cnt = 1
    x += 1
    genome2 = genome[x:x + 1]
```

Now a little about my education. I am not a programmer by education, I am an accountant-economist. I studied 3 years in college, then 3 years at the university and then worked in my specialty, but then I decided to change my field of activity.

As for English, it’s not very good, I studied it both at school and at the university, but due to the fact that I stopped studying it, it worsened significantly, so I need to improve my English
