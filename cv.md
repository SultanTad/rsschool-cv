## Briefly About Myself:

I really enjoy development and one of my goals is to become a senior full stack web developer. What about my strengths are perseverance and perseverance, I am ready to go to the end and I believe that I will definitely achieve my goals. I came to this course not a beginner in development, I have little experience, I studied python for 7 months, then I went for an internship at a local company, it was my friend's web studio, but there was no python, there was javascript and layout, i.e. e frontend. The internship lasted 3 months. Unfortunately, I did not pass the internship, but I did not give up and moved on.I went to another small company and now I'm doing an internship in it, and it seems that soon I will participate in the development of a combat project, we will write in Vue and Nuxt. Also in parallel I am doing an online store project where I use Node, Postgres and Express, the frontend will most likely be Vue. The project has not yet been uploaded to git, so I canâ€™t throw off the code example.But there are pioneers in the code of educational projects:
